> My name is Vitor Eduardo de Souza Costa, I'm a Mechatronic Engineering student, coursing this bachelor at USP in the EESC institute. At first semester of 2024, I have the subject SCC0530 - Artificial Inteligence on my schedule. On this repository, I'm going to register all codes I make to study or to conclude proposed exercises. These codes and exercises are going to be separed by folders of each learning paradigm and learning mode required during this course, including some manual analysis to learn more of the theoretical part of the models.
